Hey,

This is Aditya and i love all things data.

Currently working with walmart as a full stack software developer, currently working with:
Big data technologies such as *Spark*, *hive*, *bigquery*, *GCP dataproc*, and then exposing them through APIs with *Spring*, *FASTAPI* and also at times *Go*.
I also sometimes work with *React* as frontend, *Google ADK* for agentic AIs, *chainlit* for agentic chatapps, and to some extent devops tech like *concord* and *kubernetes*.

I am huge data person and through this blog I will try to share my experiences with all that excites me and also what i am currently learning/fixating on.
